////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//C++ CHEATSHEET
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

[1] Always use ++a as a++ returns a copy of the object; ++a returns a reference.

[2] If you only need a pointer or reference to an object, forward declare
    the object to keep the namepsace clean. Use the #include in the .cpp

[3] Move Constructor/Assignment operator are only created when none of the
    implicit five methods are defined and they are needed.

[4] All single argument constructors must be declared with 'explicit' to
    prevent unwanted casting to the single argument's type.

[5] If multiple inheritance and both classes inherited share a base, inherit each 
    virtually and call the shared base class in the initialization list alongside 
    them both. Both will not call their base class.

[6] Constructor body called base->derived. Destructor body called derived->base

[7] Member variables initialized in order they appear in class declaration,
    not in intialization list. Always keep list in same order as class .h.
    Always initialise members in constructor initialisation list as it's
    must quicker than assigning in the body

[8] sizeof on an int gives the size of the int. sizeof on an array gives the
    size of the whole array.

[9] String literals are not constant but changing individual characters is.
    char * one = "one"; one = "two" can be done.
    char * lit = "literal"; lit[0] = 'h' cannot be done.

[10] Order that function arguments/calls are evaluated is up to the complier.
     MyFn(getA(), myInt); getA/myInt called in any order
     y = x++ - getA(); x++/getA evaluated in any order
     getA() && getB(); conditional logic always left to right

[11] 'this' can be used in constructor except to call virtual functions 
      which is undefined behaviour. Base version will be called but dangerous

[12] 'delete this' calls the destructor.

[13] Assigning/Copying by-val from Derived to Base causes slicing where 
     the derived information is lost

[14] Virtual methods can't be templates as templates generated at compile time
     and virtual method type solved at run-time.

[15] Don't store an array of derived class objects in a base class pointer.
     Pointer arithmatic uses sizeof(Baseclass), not sizeof(Derivedclass)
     delete [] myArray and myArray[x] also uses pointer arithmatic

[16] Type of object/pointer determines the visibility of methods called
     even if pointer holds derived object. Known as non-virtual interface idiom

[17] Never redefine default variables from the base class; base class 
     pointers will always use base class default values.

[18] Throw by value; catch by reference to allow polymorphism.
     Never throw pointers as memory may not exist when unwinding the stack.

[19] With #define f(x) make sure to include brackets around the x inside the
     defined body: ((x)+=2) in case x is an expression

[20] Compiler sees these as function declarations
     MyClass obj(MyClass2(value)); Fixed by MyClass obj((MyClass2(value)));
     MyClass obj(); Fixed by MyClass obj;

[21] Between two sequence points a variable must not be modified more than once. 
     Eg. i = ++i is bad.

[22] Using swap/= on a shared pointer removes it from the previous reference 
     count and adds it onto the new reference count.

[23] Never use unsigned int when looping backwards to 0. When decrementing past
     zero the unsigned int will cycle over and the loop will not end

[24] For pointer math a[i] is the same as i[a] as its converted to *(a + i)

[25] Use auto for lambda return types as a conversion is needed to return as
     std::function. Only use std::function if needed to pass lambda.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//STL CHEATSHEET
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

[1] Always use Empty() instead of Size() == 0 as Empty() is always constant time
    while Size() can be linear time lookup depending on the container

[2] Inserting/Removing causes most cached iterators/pointers/references to be 
    invalidated depending on the container type. This includes iterators in a loop.

[3] Deque/Stack/Queue are not safe with pointer maths as memory not all in 
    one piece. Stores data in various chucks with pointers to keep track of 
    next lot. Use iterators to traverse.

[4] myMap[key] = "something" will add an entry if the key doesn't exist

[5] Use std::bitset/boost::dynamicbitset. vector<bool> is not a container and 
    vector<bool>::iterator is not random-access, forward or bi-directional.
    The bitset containers also have more flexibility in methods.
    
[6] Never use auto_ptr with a container. Containers often copy and assign
    and create temporary copies of data in their methods. Copying the auto_ptr 
    passes ownership of memory and sets original auto_ptr to null. 

[7] Inserting into a deque invalidates all iterators/references unless   
    inserted member is at the front or back in which iterators are invalidated 
    and references are not. 

[8] Erasing from a deque invalidates all iterators/references unless the erased member 
    is from the front or back in which only the erased member is invalidated.
    
[9] Queue and Stack are built on top of Deque
    Priority Queue is build on top of a combined Vector/Heap.
    Map is based on a balanced binary tree, Unordered Map is based on a hash table

[10] STL Containers/Strings lack a virtual destructor. You shouldn't inherit from them.

[11] std::remove doesn't actually remove any elements, only moves the wanted items
     to the front of the container and returns an iterator to the end of this range.
     Use the erase-remove idiom for vector/deque and member methods for list/maps.

[12] std::remove, std::remove_if, std::unique don't work with associative containers. 
     Use member methods or for loop to remove members.

[13] Data for strings not guaranteed to be stored in continuous memory
     Internal representation of string not guaranteed to end with null character

[14] Prefer != for iterators to < as < only works with random access iterators

[15] Prefer '\n' to std::endl as std::endl also flushes the stream buffer

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//C# CHEATSHEET
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

[1] struct Derived : IBase1, IBase2 {} Inherit no classes, multiple interfaces
    class Derived : Base, IBase {} Inherit one class, multiple interfaces
    interface Derived : IBase1, IBase2 {} Extends multiple interfaces

[2] Classes cannot be more visible than their base classes- base interfaces can have
    any visibility. Interfaces cannot be more visible than their base interfaces.

[3] Calling a virtual/abstract function in constructor is undefined behaviour.
    Derived version will be called but dangerous.

[4] Constructor body called base->derived. Destructor body called derived->base

[5] Always override ToString() as all user definded objects inherit System.Object

[6] Always initialise with the declaration unless the variable is to have the 
    default value that's auto-assigned

[7] Destructor is actually the Finaliser

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//C++/CLI CHEATSHEET
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

[1] Don't change insides of pointer to System::string as it's interned- for each
    occurance of a particular string only occurs once in memory and can be 
    referenced by multiple variables. 

[2] Always create a finaliser/destructor pair if needing to release 
    managed/unmanaged resources.
